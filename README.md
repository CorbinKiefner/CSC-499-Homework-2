# CSC-499-Homework-2
Taking the code from Homework 1, adding some new features, and uploading it to GitHub

The program takes 2 inputs, the first is the name of the file you wish to sort.
In this case it is "Sort Me.txt" exactly.
The second input is whether or not you wish to reverse the sorted list.
If you wish to do you, type -r or --reverse after the filename.
If you do not with to sort in reverse order, only type the filename.

Acceptable command lines to run the program properly are as follows:
Homework2.py "Sort Me.txt" -r
Homework2.py "Sort Me.txt" --reverse
Homework2.py "Sort Me.txt" 
Homework2.py "yourfilenamehere.txt"

The program will create a new txt file with the sorted list.
